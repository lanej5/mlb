## Logistic Regression Model




## Bayesian Logistic Regression Model with Assumed Density Filtering

Team strengths are modelled as Gaussian RVs $\theta_i \sim N( \mu_i, \sigma_i^2)$.

The likelihood the home team wins is defined the same as in the logistic regression model,

$$ p(h | \theta_h, \theta_v) = \sigma(a (\theta_h - \theta_v) + b).$$
