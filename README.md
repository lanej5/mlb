# An interactive dashboard for the MLB postseason race

I'm a big baseball fan so I made a dashboard for visualizing the MLB postseason race.

I had a few basic goals for this project:
- Create and deploy a live interactive dashboard.
- Implement a pipeline for ingesting real world data.
- Learn to use github actions to deploy services on `git push`.

I'm currently developing forecasting models and incorperating those forecasts into the plot.
